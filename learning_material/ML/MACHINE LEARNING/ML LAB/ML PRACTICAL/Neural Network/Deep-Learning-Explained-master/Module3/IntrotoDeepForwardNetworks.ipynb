There have been many answers to this question over the history of computing. In this case, we will take a practical view, sometimes known as **weak AI**. There are three key properties an intelligent machine must have; a **representation** for the AI model, **inference** for the output of the model, and **learning** to train the model.

The perceptron was proposed by Rosenblatt (1962). He built on the earlier attempts at a neural network models by McCulloch and Pitts (1943) and Heeb (1949).

The failure of the preceptron to learn an **exclusive or (XOR)** function is well known. See for example, Section 6.1 in GBC. \n","\n","Again, this representation is certainly learnable. However, as before, it does not gain us anything over well known logistic regression models."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DM2UeMCY-wQ0"},"source":["### 2.3 Forward networks - A better representation!\n","\n","The problem with the  perceptron is one of representation. There is no way that this simple network can represent anything but a linearly separable function. To represent more complex functions, we need a more complex network. In more technical terms we need a network with greater **model capacity**. \n","\n","What we need is a network with layers of **hidden nodes** with nonlinear activation. The figure below shows a simple example of a neural network with one **hidden layer** with two nodes. Since every node (including inputs) is connected to every other node we call this architecture a **fully connected neural network**.\n","\n","\n","<img src=\"img/Hidden.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width:600px; height:350px\"/>\n","<center>**Figure 2.3  \n","Fully connected neural network with single hidden layer**</center>\n","\n","Let's walk through some aspects of these diagrams. \n","\n","1.

In fact, Cybenko (1989) showed that such a network with an infinite number of hidden units using sigmoidal activation can approximate any arbitrary function. Hornik (1991) generalized this to apply to any activation function. We call this theorem the **universal approximation theorem**.  \n","\n","A universal approximation theorem may seem like a really exciting development; especially if you are a machine intelligence nerd. However, one must be circumspect when viewing such a result. A representation with an infinite number of nodes cannot be learned in any practical sense. Still it is comforting to know that, at least in principle, a representation can be learned for arbitrarily complex problems. \n","\n","While infinitely wide networks with a single layer are unrealistic, we are not limited to one layer. In fact, depth is typically more effective at creating complex representations rather than width in neural networks. Depth is measured by the count of hidden layers stacked one on top of the other in the network. Hence, the term deep neural networks. \n","\n","The Figure 2.4 below shows the results of an empirical study by Goodfellow, Shlens and Szegedy (2014) of accuracy of the network vs depth. Notice that accuracy increases rapidly with depth until about 8 layers, after which the effect is reduced. \n","\n","\n","<img src=\"img/Accuracy-Layers.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width:600px; height:350px\"/>\n","<center>**Figure 2.4 Empirical results of accuracy vs. number of layers**  \n","Diagram from Goodfellow et. al. 2014</center>\n","\n","Another view of the empirical study by Goodfellow et. al. is shown in Figure 2.5 below. In this case accuracy verses number of model parameters is compared for three different network architectures. The deeper network (11 layers) makes more  efficient use of the parameters in terms of improved accuracy. The number of parameters in a layer is approximately the total number of parameters divided by the number of layers. Notice that for the particular case tested convolutional neural networks are more efficient than fully-connected networks. We will discuss convolutional neural networks in a subsequent lesson. \n","\n","Of particular interest is the fact that the fully-connected network and the shallow convolutional neural network appear to be over-fitting as the test accuracy actually decreases as the number of parameters increases.

The answer is not only yes we can, but that we can do so in a computationally efficient manner, using a cleaver algorithm known as **backpropagation**. \n","\n","The backpropagation algorithm was developed independently multiple times. The earliest work on this algorithm was by Kelly (1960) in the context of control theory and Bryson (1961) in the context of dynamic programming.

The lower the loss, the better the fit. \n","\n","To train deep learning models **cross entropy** is often used as a loss function. This is an information theoretic measure of model fit. We can understand cross entropy as follows. \n","\n","First define **Shannon entropy** as:\n","\n","$$\\mathbb{H}(I) = E[I(X)] = E[-ln_b(P(X))] = - \\sum_{i=1}^n P(x_i) ln_b(P(x_i)$$  \n","Where:  \n","$E[X] = $ the expectation of $X$.  \n","$I(X) = $ the information content of $X$.   \n","$P(X) = $ probability of $X$.  \n","$b = $ base of the logarithm.    \n","\n","This rather abstract formula gives us a way to compute the expected information content of a set of values $X$.

Fortunately, we do not have to. We can rewrite the KL divergence as:\n","\n","$$\\mathbb{D}_{KL}(P \\parallel Q) = \\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)\\ ln_b p(x_i) - \\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)\\ ln_b q(x_i)$$\n","\n","Since $P(X)$ is fixed and we wish to find $Q(X)$ when we train our model, we can minimize the term on the right, which is the **cross entropy** defined as:\n","\n","$$\\mathbb{H}(P,Q) = - \\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)\\ ln_b q(x_i)$$\n","\n","From the formulation of KL divergence above you can see the following.\n","\n","$$\\mathbb{D}_{KL}(P \\parallel Q) = \\mathbb{H}(P) + \\mathbb{H}(P,Q)\\\\\n","\\mathbb{D}_{KL}(P \\parallel Q) = Entropy(P) + Cross\\ Entropy(P,Q)$$\n","\n","Thus, we can minimize divergence by minimizing cross entropy.
