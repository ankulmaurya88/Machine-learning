Well, that goes way-way back to 18th Century. The mighty Carl Friedrich Gauss first proposed the most trivial form of statistical regression, but there are many arguments on this. Let's not get into those. But if you are interested to see the arguments that took place for this between Gauss and Adrien-Marie Legendre, this is the link to check out.\n","\n","Linear regression is perhaps one of the most well known and well-understood algorithms in statistics and machine learning. Linear regression was developed in the field of statistics and is studied as a model for understanding the relationship between input and output numerical variables, but with the course of time, it has become an integral part of modern machine learning toolbox.\n","\n","Let's have a toy dataset for it. You will use the same house price prediction dataset to investigate this but this time with two features. The task remains the same i.e., predicting the house price.\n","\n","Source: Andrew Ng's lecture notes\n","\n","As mentioned earlier, now the x’s are two-dimensional which means your dataset contains two features. For instance, x1(i) is the living area of the i-th house in the training set, and x2(i) is its number of bedrooms.\n","\n","To perform regression, you must decide the way you are going to represent h. As an initial choice, let’s say you decide to approximate y as a linear function of x:\n","\n","hθ(x) = θ0 + θ1x1 + θ2x2\n","Here, the θi’s are the parameters (also called weights) parameterizing the space of linear functions mapping from X to Y. In a simpler sense, these parameters are used for accurately mapping X to Y. But to keep things simple for your understanding, you will drop the θ subscript in hθ(x), and write it simply as h(x). To simplify your notation even further, you will also introduce the convention of letting x0 = 1 (this is the intercept term), so that\n","\n","\n","\n","where on the right-hand side above you are considering θ and x both as vectors, and here n is the number of input instances (not counting x0).\n","\n","But the main question that gets raised at this point is how do you pick or learn the parameters θ? You cannot change your input instances as to predict the prices. You have only these θ parameters to tune/adjust.\n","\n","One prominent method seems to be to make h(x) close to y, at least for the training examples you have. To understand this more formally, let's try defining a function that determines, for each value of the θ’s, how close the h(x(i))’s are to the corresponding y(i) ’s. The function should look like the following:\n","\n","\n","\n","Source: StackOverflow\n","\n","To understand the reason behind taking the squared value instead of the absolute value, consider this squared-term as an advantage for the future operations to be performed for training the regression model. But if you want to dig deeper, help yourself.\n","\n","You just saw one of the most important formulas in the world of Data Science/Machine Learning/Statistics. It is called as cost function.\n","\n","This is an essential derivation because not only it gives birth to the next evolution of the linear regression (Ordinary Least Squares) but also formulates the foundations of a whole class of linear modeling algorithms (remember you came across a term called Generalized Linear Models).\n","\n","It is important to note that, linear regression can often be divided into two basic forms:\n","\n","Simple Linear Regression (SLR) which deals with just two variables (the one you saw at first)\n","Multi-linear Regression (MLR) which deals with more than two variables (the one you just saw)\n","These things are very straightforward but can often cause confusion.\n","\n","You have already laid your foundations of linear regression. Now you will study more about the ways of estimating the parameters you saw in the above section. This estimation of parameters is essentially known as the training of linear regression. Now, there are many methods to train a linear regression model Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) being the most popular among them. So, it is good to refer a linear regression model trained using OLS as Ordinary Least Squares Linear Regression or just Least Squares Regression.\n","\n","Note that the parameters here in this context are also called model coefficients.\n","\n","Optimizing a linear regression model - various approaches:\n","Learning/training a linear regression model essentially means estimating the values of the coefficients/parameters used in the representation with the data you have.\n","\n","In this section, you will take a brief look at some techniques to prepare a linear regression model.\n","\n","Least squares' regression:\n","You left the previous section with a notion to choose θ so as to minimize J(θ). To do so, let’s use a search algorithm that starts with some \"initial guess\" for θ, and that iteratively changes θ to make J(θ) smaller, until hopefully, you converge to a value of θ that minimizes J(θ). Specifically, let’s consider the gradient descent algorithm, which starts with some initial θ, and repeatedly performs the update:\n","\n","Source: Andrew Ng's lecture notes\n","\n","(This update is simultaneously performed for all values of j = 0, . . . , n.) Here, α is called the learning rate. This is a very natural algorithm that repeatedly takes a step in the direction of steepest decrease of J. This term α effectively controls how steep your algorithm would move to the decrease of J. It can be pictorially expressed as the following:\n","\n","Source: ml-cheatsheet\n","\n","Intuitively speaking, the above formula denotes the small change that happens in J w.r.t the θj parameter and how it affects the initial value of θj.

This means that given a regression line through the data we calculate the distance from each data point to the regression line, square it, and sum all of the squared errors together. This is the quantity that ordinary least squares seeks to minimize.\" - Jason Brownlee\n","\n","Optimization with gradient descent:\n","In the previous training rule, you already got the notion of how gradient descent can be incorporated in this context. Essentially, gradient descent is a process of optimizing the values of the coefficients by iteratively minimizing the error of the model on your training data.\n","\n","More briefly speaking, it works by starting with random values for each coefficient. The sum of the squared errors is calculated for each pair of input and output values. A learning rate is used as a scale factor, and the coefficients are updated in the direction towards minimizing the error. The process is repeated until a minimum sum squared error is achieved or no further improvement is possible.\n","\n","The term α (learning rate) is very important here since it determines the size of the improvement step to take on each iteration of the procedure.\n","\n","Now there are commonly two variants of gradient descent:\n","\n","The method that looks at every example in the entire training set on every step and is called batch gradient descent.\n","The method where you repeatedly run through the training set, and each time you encounter a training example, you update the parameters according to the gradient of the error with respect to that single training example only. This algorithm is called stochastic gradient descent (also incremental gradient descent).\n","That is all for gradient descent for this tutorial. Now, you take a look at another way of optimizing a linear regression model, i.e. Regularization.\n","\n","Regularization:\n","DataCamp already has a good introductory article on Regularization. You might want to check that out before proceeding with this one.\n","\n","Generally, regularization methods work by penalizing the coefficients of features having extremely large values and thereby try to reduce the error. It not only results in an enhanced error rate but also, it reduces the model complexity. This is particularly very useful when you are dealing with a dataset that has a large number of features, and your baseline model is not able to distinguish between the importance of the features (not all features in a dataset are equally important, right?).\n","\n","There are two variants of regularization procedures for linear regression are:\n","\n","Lasso Regression: adds a penalty term which is equivalent to the absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficients (also called L1 regularization). The penalty terms look like:\n","\n","where,\n","\n","λ is the constant factor that you add in order to control the speed of the improvement in error (learning rate)\n","the dataset has (M+1) features, so it runs from 0 to M. wj is the weight/coefficient.\n","Ridge Regression: adds a penalty term which is equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients (also called L2 regularization).

You already saw how gracefully linear regression introduces some of the most critical concepts of Machine Learning such as cost functions, optimization, variable relationships and what not? All these things are vital even if you are constructing a neural network. The applicability may differ in some places, but the overall concepts remain precisely the same. So, without understanding these fundamental things, you will never be able to reason why your neural net is not performing well.\n","\n","Moreover, a simple concept of deriving the relationships among variables gave birth to so many concepts and most importantly it created a whole new family of algorithms - Generalized Linear Models.

R-squared is the “percent of variance explained” by the model. That is, R-squared is the fraction by which the variance of the errors is less than the variance of the dependent variable. R-squared values range from 0 to 1 and are commonly stated as percentages from 0% to 100%. R-squared will give you an estimate of the relationship between movements of a dependent variable based on an independent variable's movements. It doesn't tell you whether your chosen model is good or bad, nor will it tell you whether the data and predictions are biased. A high or low R-square isn't necessarily good or bad, as it doesn't convey the reliability of the model, nor whether you've chosen the right regression.
